# REST API using MERN

## Author: Imtiaz Adar

### REST API is basically all about applying GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods.
### I have used "postman" here for POST, PUT, DELETE requests. And the GET method is
### applied as usual. I used Node JS, and Express JS here for writing codes. And
### MongoDB was my database. Thank you.
